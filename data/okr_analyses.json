    "proposal": "Build a loyalty points feature to improve retention",
    "result": " Fit score: 7\n\nAlignment analysis: The proposed \"Build a loyalty points feature to improve retention\" partially aligns with the given OKRs. This proposal addresses the first objective, \"Increase user retention by 20%,\" but does not explicitly support the second objective, \"Expand features to support international users.\"\n\nWhat's missing: The proposal lacks a clear plan for how the loyalty points feature will cater to an international audience and thus address the second OKR.\n\nSuggestions to improve fit: To better align with the given OKRs, the following changes can be made:\n1. Modify the proposal to include a design that takes into account cultural differences in reward preferences across different countries, enhancing its appeal to international users (helps achieve the second OKR).\n2. Conduct user research and gather data on user behavior in various regions to identify localized features that can improve retention rates for each target market (directly supports the first OKR).\n3. Develop a plan for translating the loyalty points feature interface into multiple languages, ensuring ease of use for international users (further supports the second OKR)."
